# Python Text Calculator
This calculator provides a lot of the normal functionality that you would expect from a calculator. To start the calculator you will want to go to open a terminal window and locate to this directory. Next run the following commands:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will start the calculator. I will not explain how to use the calculator because you can get all the information you need through the calculator's `help` function.
